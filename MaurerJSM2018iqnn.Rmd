# Introduction
## Motivation

$k$ Nearest-Neighbors (KNN): 

- Provides localized non-parametric estimation over feature space
- Computationally expensive distance calculations and sorting
- Efficient algorithms for approximate nearest neightborhoods (AKNN)

\vspace{.5cm}

Iterative Quantile Nearest-Neighbors (IQNN):

- Can we make neighborhoods with binned-partitions of feature space?
- Checking for points in intervals fast 
- Partition with $k$ training points per partition
- Use iterative algorithm of quantile-based univariate partitions

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```


## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```
